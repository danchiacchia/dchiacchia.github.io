abstract: The global pandemic has been ongoing for over 3 months with no end in sight. With over 7 million cases and half a million deaths to date globally, it is not surprising that many individuals world-wide are feeling depressed, hopeless, anxious, and fearful. The purpose of the current online study was to examine predictors of depression within the context of COVID-19 in an international sample. Participants, recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk, *N* = 750), were adults from Canada (*n* = 150), the United States (*n* = 150), Italy (*n* = 150), Germany (*n* = 150), and the United Kingdom (*n* = 150). Predictors included, extent to which one’s occupation presented risks of getting coronavirus, self-efficacy in dealing with the virus, received social support from friends or family, received support from social media, e.g., email, Facebook, extent to which one’s plans were affected by the virus, as well as degree of self-reported worry and how good one’s health is in general. Results from a multiple regression model showed that the predictors accounted for 35% of the variance in depression related to COVID-19. Occupational risk, poor health, worry, and a greater number of affected plans, significantly predicted greater depression. Further, self-efficacy related to dealing with coronavirus significantly predicted lower depression as did support from friends or family. However, findings showed that greater exposure to social media was related to higher levels of depression, which may be due to the continual dismal news on social media of the toll that COVID-19 is taking. These results shed light on the experience of depression during COVID-19 by examining the association between psychological variables and self-reported depression. The findings have consequences for the relationship between depression, stressors, occupational functioning, and social support received during a pandemic. Implications of the results for interventions that can be implemented during pandemics to improve mental health are discussed.
